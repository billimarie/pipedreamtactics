Everyone's got a pipe dream. <a href="http://pipedreamtactics.wordpress.com">What's yours</a>?

## About

**Pipe Dream Tactics** is an interactive, online community built to create a virtual space for housing pipe dreams.

##### *A pipe dream is a goal, vision, or lifestyle which outsiders often categorize as silly, unrealistic, and even impossible.*

Big visions, small goals. Passing fancies, haunting obsessions. Broken, ignored. From the serious demands for change and passionate side projects, to dedicated ventures or worldly adventures, patterns emerge from our collective pipe dreamin'.

##### *You are what you dream to be.*

Pipe Dream Tactics is not about achieving pipe dreams. It’s not about the arriving. It’s not even about the journey. It’s just about showing up.

What would life be like if we actively encouraged pipe dreaming? What would we be like?

Let’s dream for the sake of dreaming. Let’s acknowledge pipe dream impracticalities, consider the impossibility of reaching an ideal…yet continue, regardless.
